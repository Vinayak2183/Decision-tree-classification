# Decision Tree Classification

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of Decision Tree Classification using the `Social_Network_Ads.csv` dataset. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, train a Decision Tree classifier, and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `Social_Network_Ads.csv`, which contains information about users, including:
- Age
- Estimated Salary
- Purchased (Target Variable)

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling)
- Splitting dataset into training and test sets
- Training a Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluating the model performance using confusion matrix and accuracy score
- Visualizing decision boundaries

## Results
The Decision Tree model is evaluated based on:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Visualization of Decision Boundaries
